問題: Do you think that people should be restricted from using cars in city centers?

指定単語数: 140

解答: I think that people should be restricted from using cars in city centers. There are two reasons to support my opinion. First of all, having no cars will lead to better safety for pedestrians. City centers have tons of pedestrians, and this increases the chance for cars to accidentally cause them injuries. For example, there are a lot of instances where car drivers hit pedestrians or bicyclists by accidents in crowded city centers. Second of all, getting rid of cars will leave more space for pedestrians. City centers often have so many people that they cannot fit within the sidewalk. For instance, getting rid of cars will allow pedestrians to walk on the road as well, creating more space for people to comfortably walk without congestion. According to the reasons stated above, cars should be restricted from city centers.

修正案
　I believe that people should be restricted from using cars in city centers. There are two reasons to support my opinion.

　Firstly, prohibiting cars would enhance pedestrian safety. City centers are heavily populated with pedestrians, increasing the likelihood of accidental injuries caused by cars. For example, there have been numerous incidents where car drivers accidentally hit pedestrians or bicyclists in crowded city centers.

　Secondly, eliminating cars would free up more space for pedestrians. City centers often experience overcrowding to the extent that sidewalks cannot accommodate everyone. For instance, removing cars would enable pedestrians to utilize the road as well, thereby providing more room for comfortable walking without congestion.

　Based on the reasons stated above, restrictions on cars in city centers should be implemented.
